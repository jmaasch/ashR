# `ashR`

`ashR` (ash-er): Bespoke interpolated color palettes for data visualization in R.

Author: JRMA Maasch (2020).

## About

This package provides made-to-order discrete color palettes in an interpolated range. These low-contrast color palettes are intended for use cases in which subtle variation is desired. **Note: This package is currently under development.**

Bespoke color palette packages can expedite data visualization tasks. If you would like your own bespoke package, message me at www.linkedin.com/in/jmaasch.

*Note on accessibility: These color palettes were customized for use by a color-blind data scientist, though we cannot guarantee usefulness for all color-blind individuals.*
