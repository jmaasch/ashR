## About

This package provides made-to-order discrete color palettes in an interpolated range. These low-contrast color palettes are intended for use cases in which subtle variation is desired. **Note: This package is currently under development.**

Bespoke color palette packages can expedite data visualization tasks. If you would like your own bespoke package, message me at www.linkedin.com/in/jmaasch.
